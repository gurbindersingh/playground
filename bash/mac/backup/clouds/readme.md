# Cloud backups

## Requirements

- Follow the 3-2-1 method.
- Backups must be incremental.
- The faster drive serves as the primary backup, the slower drive as the
  long-term backup.
- Files that have been deleted or changed in the past 6-12 months should still
  be accessible on the primary drive.
  - If space runs out, delete the oldest redundant files first.
  - The long-term backup should only store monthly snapshots.
